"""Shared, app-wide resources built in lifespan and read via DI.

``AppState`` lives on ``app.state.resources`` and is reached through the
``StateDep`` dependency — routers never touch ``app.state`` directly. Data
resolution goes through :func:`dataset_handle` (the multi-dataset registry);
the encoder/voice slots stay ``None`` until first use so an FTS-only
deployment never connects to a GPU server.
